## Tutorial: Setting High CPU Priority for Applications

This tutorial explains how to set a high CPU priority for any application using the Registry Editor in Windows. This can potentially improve the application's performance by allocating more CPU resources to it.

**Steps:**

1.  Open the Registry Editor. You can do this by typing "Registry Editor" in the Windows search bar and selecting the application.
2.  Navigate to the following path in the Registry Editor: 
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options
```
3.  Open Task Manager and go to the "Details" tab. Find the executable name of the application for which you want to set high CPU priority.
4.  In the Registry Editor, under "Image File Execution Options", right-click and create a new key. Name this key after the application's executable name (as found in Task Manager).
5.  Right-click on the newly created application key and create another new key named "perf options".
6.  Inside the "perf options" key, right-click and create a new DWORD (32-bit) Value. Name this value "CPU Priority Class".
7.  Double-click on the "CPU Priority Class" value and set its Value data to 3. This corresponds to "High" priority.
8.  Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

After restarting, the application you configured will run with high CPU priority.
