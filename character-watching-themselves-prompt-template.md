**Explanation of Placeholders:**

*   `[Character Name (and Source if needed)]`: The main character in the room, including their origin if it helps define them (e.g., "Jessie (Team Rocket in Pokemon)").
*   `[TV Content Watched]`: What the character is described as watching (e.g., "her own anime," "the show").
*   `[TV Screen Scene Description]`: Detailed description of what's visible on the CRT screen. This is a key area for customization, including the style (anime, cartoon), the character on screen, their outfit, and expression.
*   `[Character Pose on Floor]`: How the character is sitting (e.g., "sitting on the floor," "sitting cross-legged").
*   `[Character Realism Style]`: Describes the art style of the character in the room (e.g., "in a semi-realistic style," or leave blank if it's just "her usual outfit" implying a more direct representation).
*   `[Character Outfit Description]`: Detailed description of what the character in the room is wearing.
*   `[Additional Character Appearance/Action Details]`: Any other specific physical traits (like Alice's hair/eyes) or actions (like Yumeko holding cards).
*   `[Character Expression]`: The facial expression of the character in the room.
*   `[TV Glow Description]`: How the TV light interacts with the character.
*   `[Analog Flaw Details]`: Specifics about the photo's imperfections (overexposure, dust, grain, scratches).
*   `[Aesthetic Vibe]`: The overall mood or era the photo should evoke (e.g., "chaotic early-2000s," "nostalgic vibe").
*   `[Emphasis on Contrast]`: If you want to specifically call out the contrast between the screen and the room.

**How to Use:**

1.  Copy the entire code block.
2.  Replace the bracketed placeholders (including the brackets themselves) with the specific details for the image you want to generate.
3.  If a placeholder section isn't relevant for a particular image (e.g., no specific "Aesthetic Vibe" is needed beyond the general "grungy analog"), you can delete that placeholder and its preceding comma/conjunction if it makes grammatical sense, or simply provide a very minimal input for it (or leave its example text if it fits).

This template should give you a solid foundation to recreate your examples and generate many more variations within this cool "character watching themselves" theme!
