## How to Check If Your PC is Hacked: A Detailed Guide

This guide explains how to check if your computer has been compromised, with a focus on identifying Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and info stealers.

### Understanding Malware Types

* **Remote Access Trojans (RATs):** These malicious programs grant attackers persistent control over your computer and data.
* **Info Stealers:** These are less intrusive than RATs, focusing on extracting sensitive data without necessarily maintaining constant control. Some info stealers are designed to run once and then delete themselves, while others may run every time you log in, making them potentially easier to detect.

### Immediate Actions if Malware is Suspected

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you suspect your computer has been hacked, it's crucial to take immediate steps to secure your information:
>
> * Change all your passwords: This includes passwords for your email accounts, social media, banking, and any other online services you use.
> * Cancel any credit or debit cards that you have used on the potentially compromised computer to prevent unauthorized transactions.

### Identifying Red Flags on Your System

Several indicators might suggest your computer has been compromised:

* **Disabled Administrator Functions:** If you find that certain administrative options are greyed out and you receive a warning indicating that your system administrator has disabled these functions (especially if you are using a personal home computer), this could be a sign of malicious interference.
* **Issues with Window Security:** Check your Windows Security settings for any unusual changes. For example, if tamper protection is disabled without your knowledge, it could indicate malware trying to evade detection.
* **Exclusions in Windows Defender:** Malware often attempts to evade detection by adding exclusions to Windows Defender. Carefully review the list of exclusions. Be particularly suspicious of exclusions that involve entire drives, specific folders, or broad exceptions like "*.exe," which would disable Defender for all executable files.

### Utilizing Sysinternals for Malware Detection

> [!TIP]
> Sysinternals is a valuable suite of free tools from Microsoft that can help you inspect your system's internal workings for signs of malware. You can download the tools from the following official links:
>
> * **Process Explorer:** [Download Process Explorer](https://download.sysinternals.com/files/ProcessExplorer.zip)
> * **Autoruns:** [Download Autoruns](https://download.sysinternals.com/files/Autoruns.zip)
> * **Process Monitor:** [Download Process Monitor](https://download.sysinternals.com/files/ProcessMonitor.zip)
>
> Key tools for this purpose include:
>
> * **Autoruns:** This tool displays all the programs that are configured to run when your computer starts or when you log in. It can help you identify suspicious or unknown programs that might be loading without your consent.
> * **Process Explorer:** This advanced task manager provides detailed information about running processes. It allows you to examine the process tree and identify any unusual or unexpected processes.
> * **Process Monitor:** This tool provides real-time monitoring of file system, Registry, and process/thread activity. It's particularly useful for in-depth analysis once you have identified a potentially malicious process.

### Key Indicators within Sysinternals Tools

* **Process Tree Anomalies:** In Process Explorer, examine the process tree. Typically, `service host.exe` processes should run under `services.exe`, which in turn runs under `wininit.exe`. Any deviations from this structure could indicate suspicious activity.
* **Unverified Publishers in Autoruns:** When using Autoruns, pay close attention to entries with unverified publishers. While not all unverified publishers are malicious, they can be a sign of malware attempting to run on your system.

### Examples of Malware Behavior and Detection

* **Pylon RAT:** This type of Remote Access Trojan might not exhibit any immediate obvious effects after being executed, making it harder to detect initially.
* **Luma Stealer:** This info stealer is known to use nested archives and can create invisible command prompt windows to perform its malicious activities. It might also install persistent tasks that are unverified and run without your knowledge.
* **Minecraft RAT:** Some malware, like this example, can be designed to respawn itself even after you attempt to terminate the process, making removal more challenging.

### Additional Warning Signs

* **Blocked Anti-Malware Websites:** If you find that you are unable to access websites related to anti-malware software, such as VirusTotal, this could indicate that your host file has been modified by malware to prevent you from seeking help or downloading removal tools.

### Solutions for Dealing with an Infected System

> [!WARNING]
> If you suspect or confirm that your computer is infected, here are the recommended steps:
>
> * Disconnect from the Internet: This is crucial to prevent the attacker from further accessing your system or exfiltrating more data.
> * Use Bitdefender (or another reputable antivirus): Bitdefender offers a free antivirus solution that can be used to scan your system and attempt to remove any detected malware. Keep in mind that even the best antivirus software might not catch everything.
> * Reinstall Windows: For most users, reinstalling the Windows operating system is the most effective way to ensure that all malware is completely removed.
>     * Ideally, use the Microsoft media creation tool on a separate, uninfected computer to create a bootable USB drive or DVD.
>     * Alternatively, you can perform a PC reset, but it's essential to disconnect from the internet before doing so to prevent any potential reinfection during the process.

### Post-Reinstallation Security Measures

After reinstalling your operating system, it's vital to take these steps to secure your accounts and data:

* **Secure Cryptocurrency Wallets:** If you have any cryptocurrency wallets on the compromised computer, immediately move your funds to a secure wallet on a different, uninfected device.
* **Secure Online Accounts:** Change the passwords for all your important online accounts, including email, banking, social media, and others.
    * For your email accounts, sign out of all active sessions on all devices.
    * Check your email settings for any suspicious filters that might have been added by the attacker.
    * Consider using a password manager to generate and securely store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.
* **Cancel Credit/Debit Cards:** If you had any credit or debit card information stored on the infected computer, even if it was encrypted, it's a good precaution to cancel those cards and request new ones.
* **Consider Identity Theft Services:** If you stored unencrypted sensitive identity documents on your computer, you might want to consider using an identity theft monitoring service to help detect and mitigate any potential misuse of your personal information.

### Important Final Advice

> [!CAUTION]
> * Do not pay any ransom demands if you encounter ransomware. There is no guarantee that paying the ransom will result in the recovery of your files, and it may encourage further attacks.
> * Be vigilant and monitor your financial accounts and credit reports for any suspicious or unauthorized transactions.

By following these steps and remaining vigilant, you can significantly improve your chances of detecting and recovering from a computer hacking incident.
